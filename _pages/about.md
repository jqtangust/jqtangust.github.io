üéì I am currently a __Ph.D. student in Artificial Intelligence__ at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), under the supervision of [Prof. Yingcong Chen](https://www.yingcong.me/)(Guangzhou Campus) and [Prof. Qifeng Chen](https://cqf.io/)(Clear Water Bay Campus). Before that, I obtained a B.Eng. in Data Science and Big Data Tech., from the School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, supervised by [Prof. Wei Wei](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/weiwei.html) in 2022.
